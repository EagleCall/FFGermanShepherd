## ForestFey's GermanShepherd  
  
  
Adds a new dogbreed, the German Shepherd or Alsatian to Rimworld.  
The 2 branches only differ in the animal's capability to carry in caravans, including adapted textures.  
Needs no other mods to run and can be added to savegames, but removal is not recommended.
